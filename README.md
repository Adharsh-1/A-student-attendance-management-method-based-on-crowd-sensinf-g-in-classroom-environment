A STUDENT ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT METHOD BASED ON CROWD-SENSING IN CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT.


In smart cities, intelligent learning environment is an important application scenario, and class attendance checking is 
an important measure to urge students to attend on time and ensure the quality of learning. Aiming at the existing problems 
in class attendance checking, such as low efficiency and easy to cheat, this paper proposes a student attendance management
method named AMMoC (Attendance Management Method based on Crowdsensing). AMMoC includes two phases, i.e., the initialization
phase and the authentication phase. In the initialization phase, a teacher sends an attendance checking request to the server.
After receiving the request, the server sends a request to tell students to submit their location information, and then forms 
the student location map once the server receives all the response from students. In the authentication phase, the server verifies
the truth of the location information by sending requests to several students to count the number of students. 
The authentication phase includes two modules, i.e., the task assignment module and the attendance verification module.
In the task assignment module, AMMoC first finds the optimized sequence of subregions and verifiers by using the Monte Carlo algorithm, 
and then requires the verifiers to count the number of students in the subregion. Finally, the statistics results will be verified in the
attendance verification module. Experiment comparisons and analyses show that AMMoC has the advantages of good anti-cheating performance,
fast speed, and little disturbance to class, and is suitable for attendance checking applications in classroom environment.
